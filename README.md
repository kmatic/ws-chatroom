# Websocket Chatroom

A simple real-time chatroom built using Socket.IO. Not much time was spent on the layout and styling as I just wanted to familiarize myself with how websockets work and how to get them up and running on both the client and server.

## Built with

-   React
-   Express
-   Socket.io
-   Socket.io-client
-   Styled-components
-   parcel

## Running locally

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/kmatic/ws-chatroom
```

2. Navigate to folder and install npm packages

```
cd ws-chatroom
npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```
npm run start
```

Client is hosted on localhost:1234 and server on localhost:5000
